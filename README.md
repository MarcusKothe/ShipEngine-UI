# ShipEngine-UI
Example UI for ShipEngine API

ShipEngine UI is a project that aims to give developers a framework when being introduced to ShipEngine.

Many developers are tasked with the job of using ShipEngine to build a Shipping Application to fit their 
companyâ€™s needs. However, ShipEngine has no user interface to create shipping labels or examples for developers to follow to begin development of an application.

This may lead to confusion or trouble knowing where to begin. With ShipEngine UI, developers have not only an example,
but also an easy to follow UI and source code that can help users to understand how ShipEngine works.
